                            On seeing the dead body of his brother, Namsamay burst into tears and thought, “To save my life I have alone committed a great sin by killing my own brother”. He made up his mind to skin-out Kesamay’s skin to make something out of it as a mark of respect and remembrance. After skinning, Namsamay took it to his home and spread it to dry in the hot sun’s ray.

                            When the skin dried, Namsamay took the skin to different places carrying and showing it to the people to get something in return. Thus, Namsamay could collect eatables such as salt, garlic, chilly, oil, ginger and other food stuffs from different places and consumed them together with his mother. But both of them fell ill after consuming the collected food items.

They followed the instruction and after that they became alright. Since then mourning and perform the purification rite for the deceased family person became tradition.

                            Teegenjongna advised Namsamay to make something useful out of Kesamay’s skin as a token of love and remembrance of his older brother. So, Namsamay went to the jungle and saw bees buzzing around a tree  and the tree resounding the buzzing sound. This tree was a hongsing/Kamari. He hacked down the tree, made hole in the log and stretched the skin of Kesamay on both side of hollow-log.

                            After Kesamay’s skin was tightened, Namsamay banged it with his palm and it produced a sharp thrilling sound similar to the roaring sound of tiger. He hung the drum in his neck and started beating with his hands and the sound echoed and rocked in the far off village. Hearing such roaring sound, the people from far and wide gathered to see the drum and Namsamay.
